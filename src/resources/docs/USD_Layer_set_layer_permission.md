# `set_layer_permission`

This node changes the layer permission.

To be used for the very specific scenario when you need to reference a layer that needs to be modified by an other runtime than Bifrost.

For example, if a stage generated by Bifrost references a "file based" layer storing some USD materials who should be authored in the LookdevX Editor, it would not work by default. This is because in order to keep the referenced layer "file based", the "read only" mode would need to be enabled in the open_layer node. If not in read only mode, the opened layer ("file based" layer) would be automatically copied into an anonymous layer by Bifrost USD (to avoid side effects) and so would not be editable in LookdevX in a persistent way (as the layer identifier would change at every execution of the graph).

The node graph to open a layer in Bifrost and let it be editable outside should look as following: open_layer (with read_only "on") -> set_layer_permission (with read_only "off") -> add_reference_prim

## Inputs

### `read_only`
To set the layer as non editable. 

### `layer`
The layer in which to set the permission.
