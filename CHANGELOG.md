### Bugfix
 - EMSUSD-1195 - Disable UFE observer if Maya API version is less than 2025.2 to avoid crash in the BifrostUsdExamples plugin.


## [1.2.3] - 2024-04-17 (Bifrost 2.10)

### Build
 - BIFROST-9342 - Update to Bifrost 2.10 SDK. BifrostHd::Container is now managed by Workspace.


### Feature
 - BIFROST-9565 - Add nested Variant Sets support.

    Allow to create a VariantSet inside an existing VariantSet on its prim.
    It changes the _set_variant_selection_ operator behavior.
    Previously the "clear" parameter was used to mimic a clear variant set.
    In the new implementation, the "clear" parameter clear the current variant
    selection and add a new one in current VariantSet.
    To only clear the variant selection without setting a new one, use the
    _clear_variant_selection_ operator.

    This change allow users to create a variant set and a variant by just specifying it in the Variant Selection section of the _define_usd_prim_.
    Creating a _define_usd_variant_set_ on the parent prim is needed only to set the variant selection in a particular variant set.

 - BIFROST-9637 - Add clear_variant_selection operator.
 - BIFROST-9638 - Add "Variant Selection" group in _define_usd_curves_ and _define_usd_point_instancer_ compounds.
 - BIFROST-9611 - Add _get_prim_kind_ operator.
 - BIFROST-8154 - Add _get_prim_attribute_type_ operator.
 - BIFROST-8099 - Add _get_applied_schemas_ operator.
 - BIFROST-9186 - Add _applied_schema_names_ parameter to the _define_usd_prim_ compound.
    You can pass coma-separated names of USD Applied API Schemas.
 - BIFROST-9674 - Add _define_usd_geom_subset_ compound.
 - BIFROST-9686 - Add UI logic on _define_usd_mesh_ to disable "Subdiv" when "Normal Per Vertex" is enabled.
 - BIFROST-9673 - Add USD graphs and scenes to Bifrost Browser.
 - BIFROST-9770 - Add the "Bifrost USD Examples" plugin for Maya showing how Bifrost USD can be used to create high level workflows like:
     - Creating a Bifrost graph dedicated to USD workflows.
     - Importing a Maya hierachy in a Bifrost Graph as USD prims.
     - Creating a USD variant from a Maya hierarchy.
     - Creating a USD Model Component with variants from multiple USD files.

    In the install folder of the project, you will find the _bifrostUSDExamples.mod_ file in "examples/maya_plugin".
    You will need to add its directory path to your _MAYA_MODULE_PATH_ environment variable. An easy way is by editing the Maya.env file in your user preferences as bellow:

    `MAYA_MODULE_PATH=<your Bifrost USD install path>\examples\maya_plugin`


### Bugfix
 - BIFROST-9608 - Fix wrong parameters layout order in the Variant Selection group.

    The _variant_set_name_ and _variant_name_ parameters order is changed in the _define_usd_prim_ and _define_usd_mesh_ compounds.

 - BIFROST-9056 - Collapse ports grouping on the _define_usd_prim_attribute_ compound.
 - BIFROST-9334 - Remove compound duplicate in _save_usd_stage.json_ file.


## [1.2.2] - 2024-03-27 (Bifrost 2.9)

### Build

 - BIFROST-9332 - Update to Bifrost 2.9 SDK
 - BIFROST-8981 - Update to USD 0.23.11
 - BIFROST-9147 - Make C++17 default

### Feature

 - BIFROST-9354 - USD File Format Option

    Add parameter to set a the USD layer format to ASCII or binary. Useful to save in human readable format and still keep the .usd extension.

 -  BIFROST-9334 - Add _get_edit_layer_ operator

    This node returns the stage's EditTarget layer.


### Bugfix

 - BIFROST 9428 - Fix scalar attribute creation regression when _using add_to_stage_ compound
 - BIFROST-9334 - Fix save_usd_stage compound errors when current edit target is not the root layer
    - Update the _save_usd_stage_ compound. It is now setting the target layer to the root layer before saving and then restore the current target (using the new get_edit_layer operator).


## [1.2.1] - 2023-11-15

### Build

 - BIFROST-9103 - Replace pxr by PXR_NS
 - BIFROST-9093 - Uses cpp2json executable instead of the deprecated amino_cpp2json_foreach one.
 - BIFROST-8182 - Remove -Wno-unused-macros on Windows targets
 - BIFROST-8182 - Clang-tidy support: Add the cmake target "bifrost_usd_clang_tidy" to the build.

### Feature

 - BIFROST-8077 - Add support for half and matrix attribute types

 - BIFROST-8574 - Add anchor_path parameter on add_reference_prim and add_payload_prim

   By specifying an "anchor_path", the identifier of the referenced layer will not include such anchor path in the reference list.

 - BIFROST-8424 - Add slider and color picker on ops

 - BIFROST-9008 - Add set_layer_permission node

   To be used for the very specific scenario when you need to reference a layer
   that needs to be modified by an other runtime than Bifrost.

   For example, if a stage generated by Bifrost references a "file based" layer
   storing some USD materials who should be authored in the LookdevX Editor,
   it would not work by default. This is because in order to keep the referenced layer
   "file based", the "read only" mode would need to be enabled in the open_layer node.
   If not in read only mode, the opened layer ("file based" layer) would be automatically
   copied into an anonymous layer by Bifrost USD (to avoid side effects) and so would not
   be editable  in LookdevX in a persistent way (as the layer identifier would change at
   every execution of the graph).

   The node graph to open a layer in Bifrost and let it be editable outside should look as following:
   open_layer (with read_only "on") -> set_layer_permission (with read_only "off") -> add_reference_prim

   The open_layer node will call the BifrostUsd::Layer constructor that is "opening or finding" the USD layer
   using the file path as an identifier (and will not create an anonymous layer, because of the read only mode).
   The set_layer_permission will allow the layer to be editable and will not output an anonymous layer.

 - BIFROST-8788 - Use for_each in define_usd_mesh

 - BIFROST-7769 - use getEnv*() functions from public Executor SDK

 - BIFROST-8199 - Use ConfigEnv instead of Object to get config from environment

 - BIFROST-3401 - Use new API for FileUtils::getRelativePath.

### Bugfix

 - BIFROST-9067 - Fix connection order when creating an add_to_stage node 'on the fly'

 - BIFROST-8826 - fix random test failures on Windows

   - Layer::exportToFile() now uses SdfLayer::New() instead of CreateNew().
   This prevents a temporary and default file to be created on the disk
   before the final exported file is actually written. On Windows, when
   Pixar USD is writing an initial file and almost immediately attempts
   to replace its content by renaming another file to such initial file,
   an "access denied" error can occasionally occur; eliminating the
   temporary file on the first place by not calling CreateNew() avoids
   this error.
   - Each unit test file now outputs its exported files into its own unique
   folder, avoiding completely the possibility that two concurrent tests
   from different test files would attempt to export to the same file.
   These unique output folders are deleted as a first phase for each test
   file, allowing tests to assume and check that an output file is not
   already on disk before it is being exported.
   - Some tests were previously just lucky to succeed, as they were
   exporting a root layer and sublayer to disk, but the sublayer was
   actually exported into the default output folder, not into the expected
   folder, and since the sublayer file was already saved to disk by
   another test case, the test assumed that everything went fine. Such
   test cases are now fixed or were removed (if not fixable).
   - Tests do not export initial files first, then replacing these by final
   file content, and finally checking the final file for some expected
   content. This was also occasionally causing "access denied" errors, as
   described above.
   - add README.md in test folder

	- Use the layer's save file path (m_filePath) instead of the sdfLayerIdentifier in the recursive call to Layer::exportToFile().
	- Add new more complete unit test for export_layer_to_file() that covers multiple cases for relative and absolute paths to sublayers.
	- removed call to changeDir() that has side effect and is not required anymore for unit tests.
